<h1>Course Outline</h1>

<ol>
  <li><b>Course description:</b><br> <p>In this course, we study dynamics
  and control of systems of interconnected rigid
  bodies. We start by modeling the mechanical system in a geometric
  framework. In this framework, we reinterpret the physical concepts
  such as position, velocity, acceleration, force, energy, etc. To obtain the
  equation of motion of the mechanical system, instead of using
  Newton's laws of motion, we use Euler-Lagrange equations. Using
  differential geometric notions, one can write the equations of
  motion of the mechanical system in a coordinate-independent
  form. This coordinate-independent representation of equations of motions helps us to study controllability, stability and motion
  planning of mechanical systems.</p><br> 
  
  <li><b>Grading:</b>
  <ul>
    <li> 25% Homeworks,
    <li> 60% Final exam,
    <li> 15% Tutorials.
    </ul>
 <br> 
  <li><b>Tutorials:</b>
    <br>
    In the tutorial each week we will work through problems related to homework.
The work will be done by students at the board.
<p>
You will receive 15% of your grade from fulfilling tutorial obligations.
This consists of doing the following two things:
<ul>
<li> attending most tutorials (attendance will be taken),
<li> leading the tutorial for no less than ten minutes (time will vary) at
some point during the term.
</ul>
